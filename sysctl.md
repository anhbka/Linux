- How do I set advanced security options of the `TCP/IP` stack and virtual memory to improve the security and performance of my Linux based system? How do I configure Linux kernel to prevent certain kinds of attacks using `/etc/sysctl.conf`? How do I set Linux kernel parameters?

sysctl is an interface that allows you to make changes to a running Linux kernel. With `/etc/sysctl.conf` you can configure various Linux networking and system settings such as:

```
1. Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4
2. Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6
3. Turn on execshield protection
4. Prevent against the common ‘syn flood attack’
5. Turn on source IP address verification
6. Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address of the server.
7. Logs several types of suspicious packets, such as spoofed packets, source-routed packets, and redirects.
```

Linux Kernel `/etc/sysctl.conf` Security Hardening with sysctl

The sysctl command is used to modify kernel parameters at runtime. `/etc/sysctl.conf` is a text file containing sysctl values to be read in and set by sysctl at boot time. To view current values, enter:

```
sysctl -a
sysctl -A
sysctl mib
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
sysctl -a --pattern 'net.ipv4.conf.(eth|wlan)0.arp'

To load settings, enter:
sysctl -p
```

Sample `/etc/sysctl.conf` for Linux server hardening

Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` or `/etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf` and update it as follows. The file is documented with comments. However, I recommend reading the official Linux kernel sysctl tuning help file (see below):

```

net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

```

Reboot the machine soon after a kernel panic:

`kernel.panic=10`

Addresses of mmap base, heap, stack and VDSO page are randomized:

`kernel.randomize_va_space=2`

Ignore bad ICMP errors:

`net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses=1`

Protects against creating or following links under certain conditions

```
fs.protected_hardlinks=1
fs.protected_symlinks=1
```

### How to reload sysctl.conf variables on Linux

- Reading the Linux variable from command line

```
sysctl kernel.ostype
-->
kernel.ostype = Linux
```

* To see all variables pass the -a option as follows:

```
sysctl -a
# use the more command/grep command as filter #
sysctl -a | grep kernel
sysctl -a | more
```

* Regex support

```
sysctl -a --pattern forward
sysctl -a --pattern forward$
sysctl -a -r version
```

* Write variable from command line


The syntax is:

`sysctl -w variable=value`

To enable packet forwarding for IPv4, enter:

`sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

How to reload sysctl.conf variables on Linux

Type the following command to reload settings from config files without rebooting the box:

`sysctl --system`

The settings are read from all of the following system configuration files:
```
/run/sysctl.d/*.conf
/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/etc/sysctl.conf
```

* Persistent configuration

You need to edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` or file from the `/etc/sysctl.d/` directory. Your custom Linux kernel system variables typically goes into the `/etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf` file:

`vi /etc/sysctl.conf`

OR
`vi /etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf`

Modify or add in the file. For example:

```
vm.max_map_count=262144
vm.mmap_min_addr=65536
net.core.default_qdisc=fq
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1
```

Close and save the file. To load in sysctl settings from the file specified or `/etc/sysctl.conf` if none given, enter:
`sysctl -p`

Let us read values from file called `/etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf`:

`sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf

OR

`sudo sysctl --load=/etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf`

OR

`sudo sysctl -f /etc/sysctl.d/1000-custom.conf`
